<br><br>
"Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see." Hebrews 11:1
<br><br>
"Have faith in God," Jesus answered. "Thruly Itell you, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours." Mark 11:22-24
<br><br>
"Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, for you are receiving the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls." 1 Peter 1:8-9
<br><br>
"Being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, and giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light." Colossians 1:11
<br><br>
"But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you." Psalm 5:11
<br><br>
"You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy," Psalm 30:11
"For no word from God will ever fail." Luke 1:37
<br><br>
"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith- and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God- not by works, so that no one can boast." Ephesians 2:8-9
<br><br>
"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding, in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight." Proverbs 3:5-6
<br><br>
"For we live by faith, not by sight." 2 Corinthians 5:7
<br><br>
"Jesus replied, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree,but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done.' If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Matthew 21:21-22
<br><br>
"And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him." Hebrews 11:6
<br><br>
"Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and joy are in his dwelling place." 1 Chronicles 16:27
