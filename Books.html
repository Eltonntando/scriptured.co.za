<h2>All the 66 Books in the Bible</h2>
<h3>The length of the Bible is about 611,000 words spread across 66 shorter texts known as its "books"—is enormous.

This is so because the Bible is a compilation of texts from several authors who lived in various eras. We can read the Bible in "chunks" rather than having to read it all at once, which in some ways makes it simpler to approach.
However, it also adds some confusion. The Bible is a book unto itself. The Latin and Greek words for "book" (biblia and biblos, respectively) are actually where the word "bible" originates. It's a collection of books, though. Here is a summary of each Bible book.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Old Testament</h2>
<br><br>
The Old Testament includes 39 books which were written long before Jesus was born.
The first five books of the Bible are called the Torah, or the Law of Moses.
<h3 style="text-align: center;">THE LAW</h3>
<p>
Genesis: Chapter 1-50
<br><br>
1. Genesis answers two of massive questions: “How did God’s relationship with the world begin?” and “Where did the nation of Israel come from?” This is where the stories of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah and the Ark, the Tower of Babel, Abraham and Isaac, Jacob’s ladder, and Joseph’s coat of many colors are recorded.

Author: Traditionally Moses, but the stories are much older.
Genesis means origin orthe begginings. Ranging from the cosmos to the family, this wide-sweping book tells of the universe, the origin of the human race, the beginning of sin and sufferig in the world, and about God's way of dealing with humanity.

Genesis can be divided into two main parts: 1st. The creation of the world and the early history of the human race. Here are accounts af Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah and the flood, and together with the Tower of Babel (Chapters 1-11). 2nd. The History of the early ancestors of the Israelites.The first is Abraham, who was notable for his faith and his obedience to God. Thenfollow the stories of his son Isaac, and grandson Jacob (also known as Israel), and of Jacob's twelve sons, who were the founders of the twelve tribes of Israel. Particular attension is given to one of the sons, Joseph, and the events that brought Jacob and his other sons with their families to live in Egypt(Chapters 12-50).

While the Book of Genesis tells stories about people, it is first and foremost an account of what God has done. Introducing the drama of redemption, it begins with the affirmation that God created the universe, and it ends with a promise that God will continue to show his concern for his people. Throughout the book the main character is God, who creates human beings to live in his world, leads and helps his people, judges and punishes those who do wrong, and shapes their history. This ancient book was written to record the story of a people's faith and to help keep that faith alive.

2. Exodus: Chapter 1-40
<br><br>
God saved Israel from slavery in Egypt, and then ventures into a special relationship with them.

Author: Traditionally Moses

Exodus means depature, and refers to the most important event in Israel's history, which is described in this book - The freeing of te Israelites from bondage and their depature from Egypt, where they had been enslaved by the Pharoah.
The Book of Exodus has four main parts: 1st The miraculous freeing of the Hebrews from slavery; 2nd Their dramatic journey to Mount Sinai; 3rd God's covenant with his people at Snai, which gave them moral, civil, and religious laws to live by; 4th The building and furnishing of a place of worship for Israel, and laws regarding the priests and the worship of God. Above all, Exodus describes what God did, liberating his enslaved people and forming them into a nation with hope for the future. The lord is shown to be the one true God, ruler of the universe, whose will is unstopaable. The central human figure in the book is Moses, the man whom God chose to lead his people from Egypt. The most widely known part of the book is the list of the 'Ten Commandments' (20:1-17).

4. Numbers: Chapter 1-36
<br><br>
Israel is failing to trust and obey God, and wanders in the wilderness for a period of 40 years.

Author: Traditionally Moses
The book of Numbers is the account of Israelites' life in the desert from the time they left Mount Sinai until they reached the eastern border of Canaan, the land that God had promised to give them, a journey which took them nearly forty years. Numbers, the name of the book, emphisises an important feature of the story, the two censuses of the Israelites which Moses orginised, first at Mount Sinai before their depature, and again in Moab, east of the Jordan, about a generation later. In the period between Moses' two censuses, the Israelites went to Kadesh Brnea of the southern border of Canaan, but they failed to rnter the promised land from there. They spent many years in that area before proceeding to the region east of the River Jordan, where some of the people settled while the others prepared to cross the river into Canaan, their promised land. Numbers tells of people who were often discouraged and afraid in the face of hardship, people who rebelled against God and against Moses, the man God appointed to lead them. Yet it is also the story of God's faithfulness, his persistent care for his people in spite of their weakness and disobedience. It is also the record of Moses, steadfast, if sometimes impatient, devotion of both to God and his people.

5. Deuteronomy: Chapter 1-34
<br><br>
Moses is giving Israel instructions and guide (in a way, it is a recap of the laws in Exodus–Numbers) for how to love and obey God in the Promised Land.

Author: Traditionally Moses

The framework of the book of Deuteronomy ('second law') is a series of addresses given by Moses to the people of Israel in Moab, where they had stopped at the end of their long desert journey and were about to enter Canaan, the land God has promised them. Some of the most important matters recorded in Deuteronomy are: 1st Moses' retelling of the great events of the past forty years in the desert, appearing to the people to remember how God led them through the their long journey and to be loyal and obedient to God. 2nd MMoses review the law given to him on Mount Sinai, the 'The Ten Commandments', emphrasing the meaning of the first laws which are to govern Israel's life in their promised land. 3rd Moses' powerful reminder to the people of the serious meaning of God's covanant with them. Moses calls upon them to renew their commitment to it and to their obligation to God. 4th Joshua's commissioning as the next leader upon the tribes of Israel, Moses in Moab, east of the Jordan River.

The great theme of Deuteronomy is that God has saved and blessed his chosen people whom he loves. His people must remember this and obey and love God so that they may have life and continued blessing. The key verses of this book contain the words that Jesus called the greatest of all commandments: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength" (6:5)

7. Judges: Chapter 1-21
<br><br>
Israel enters a cycle of turning from God, falling captive to oppressive nations, calling out to God, and being rescued by leaders God sends their way (called “judges”).

Author: Nobody knows

The book of Judges contains accounts of events which took place during the lawless period of Israel's history between the invasion of Canaan and the establishment of the monarchy. These stories are about the exploits of national heroes called 'judges', most of whom were military leaders rather than judges in the strictly legal sense of the word. One of the better known of them was Samson, whose deeds are recorded in chapters 13-16.
The great and obvious lesson of Judges is that Israel's very survival depended on loyalty to God, while disloyalty always led to disaster. But at another level there is a deeper, underlying truth: even when the nation was disloyal to God, and even when disaster inevitably came, God was always ready to save his people when they repented and turned to him again.

When he dies, Ruth shows rare loyalty to Naomi, her Israelite mother-in-law, and a deep devotion to God of Israel. In the end, she finds a new husband among her former husband's relatives, andthrough this marriage becomes great-grandmother of David, Israel's greatest king. That Ruth was an ancestor of Jesus and listed in the New Testament genealogies.

9. 1 Samuel: Chapter 1-31
<br><br>
Israel demands a king, who turns out to be quite a disappointment.

Author: Nobody knows.

The first Book of Samuel records the transition in Israel from the period of the judges to the monarchy. This hugely important change in Israel's national life centred mainly around three men: Samuel, the last of the great judges; Saul, Israel's first king; and David, Israel's second greatest king, whose early adventure before coming to ower are interwoven with the accounts of Samuel and Saul. The theme of this book, like that of other historical writings in the Old Testament,is that faithfulness to God brings his blessings, while disobedience brings disaster. This is stated clearly in the Lords's message to the priest Eli: "Those who honor me i will honour, but those who despise me will be distained" (2:30)
1 Samuel records mxed feelings about the establishment of the monarchy. The Lord himself was regarded as the real king of Israel, but in response to the people's the Lord chose a king for them. The important fact was that both the king and the people of Israel lived under the sovereignty and judgement of God (2:7-10). Under God's laws, the rights of all people, rich and poor alike, were to be maintained.

<br><br>
David, a man after God’s own heart, becomes king of Israel.

Author: Nobody knows.

The Second Book of Samuel, the sequel to 1 Samuel, records the history of David's reign as king, first over Judah in the south (chapters 5-24). It is a vivid account of how David, inorder to extend his kingdom and consolidate his position, had to struggle with enemies within the nation as well as with foreign powers. David is shown to be a man of deep faith and devotion to God, and one who was able to win the loyalty of his people. Yet he is also shown as being sometimes ruthless, willing to commit grave sins to serve his own desires and ambitions. But when he is confronted with his sins by the Lord's prophet Nathan, he confesses them and accepts the punishment that Godsends. The life and achievements of David impressed the people of Israel so much that later in times of national address, when they longed for another king, itwas for one who would be a "son of David", that is, a descendant of David who would be like him. In the New Testament, tis becomes an important aspect of the way in which Jesus was understood and described.

11. 1 Kings: Chapter 1-22
<br><br>
The kingdom of Israel has a time of peace and prosperity under King Solomon, but afterward splits, and the two lines of kings turn away from God.

Author: Nobody knows.
The First Book of Kings continues the history of the Israelite monarchy begun in the Books of Samuel. 1Kings falls into three parts: 1st The succession of Solomon as king of Israel and Judah, and the death of his fater David. 2nd The reign and achievements of Solomon. His building of the Temple in Jerusalem was a significant achievement. 3rd The division of the nation into the northen and southern kingdoms, and the stories of the kings who ruled them down to the middle of the ninth century BC. In 1 and 2 Kings, each ruler is judged according to his loyalty to God, and national success is seen as depending on this loyalty. On the other hand, idoltary and disobedience lead to disaster. The kings of the northen kingdom all fail the test, while the record of Judah's kings is mixed. Prominent in 1 Kings are the prophets of the Lord, those caourageous for God who warned the people not to worship idols and not to disobey God. Especially notable is Elijah and the story of his contest with the priests of Baal (chapter 18).

Author: Nobody knows.

The second Book of Kings continues the history of the two Israelite kingdoms were 1 Kings leaves off. The book falls into two parts:1st The story of the two kingdoms from the middle of the ninth century BC down to the fall of Samaria and the end of the northern kingdoms in 722 BC; 2nd The story of the kingdom of Judah from the fall of Israel down to the capture and destruction of Jerusalem by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia in 586 BC. The book ends with an account of Gedaliah as governor of Judah under the Babylonians, and a report of the release of King Jehoiachin of Judah from prisom in Babylon. These national disasters took place because of unfaithfulness of the kings and people of Israel and Judah. The destruction of Jerusalem and the exile of many of the people of Judah was one of the great turning points of Israelite history. The prophet who stands out in 2 Kings is Elijah's successor Elisha.

Author: Traditionally Ezra.

1 Chronicles is the first of the Books of Chronicles which are largely the retelling of events recorded inthe Books of Samuel and Kings, but from a different point of view. Two main purposes govern the account of the history of the Israelite monarchy in the Books of Chronicles: 1st To show that in spite of the disasters thathad fallen upon the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, God was still keeping his promises to the nation and was working out his plan for his people through those who were living in Judah. As a basis for this assurance, the writer looked to the great achievements of David and Solomon, to the reforms of Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah, and the Temple at Jerusalem, and especially the organizationof the origin of the worship of God in the Temple at Jerusalem, and especially the organization of the priests and Levites, by which the worship was carried out. David is presented as the real founder of the Temple and its ritual, even though it is Solomon who builds the Temple.

18. Job: Chapter 1-42
<br><br>
Satan attacks a righteous man named Job, and Job and his friends argue about why terrible things are happening to him.

Author: Nobody knows.

The Book of Job is the story of a good man who suffers total disaster, losing all his children and property and suffering with a repulsive disease. Then in three series of poetic dialogues the author shows how Job's friends and Job himself react to these calamities. In the end, God himself, whose dealings with humanity have been a prominent part of the discission, appears to Job. Job's friends try to explain his suffering in traditional religious terms. Believing that in this life God always rewards good and punishes evil, Job's friends assume that the sufferings of Job can only mean that he has sinned. They offer him advice based on their assumptions. But for Job this is too simple; he knows he does not deserve such cruel punishment, because he has been an unusually good and righteous man. He cannot understand how God can let so much evil happen to someone like himself while other obviously wicked people seem to prosper. Job boldly challenges God. He does not lose his faith, but he longs to be justidied before God and the to regain his honour as a good man. God does not give  the answer to Job's questions which Job might have expected. Instead God responds to Job's faith by giving him a powerful, poetic picture of his devine power and wisdom. Job then realises that God is in control and humbly acknowledges God as wise and great, repenting of the wild and angry words he had used. The prose conclusion records how Job is restored to his former condition, with even greater prosperity than before. God reprimands Job's friends for failing to understand the meaning of Job's suffering. Only Job had really sensed that God is greater than traditional religion had depicted him.

19. Psalms: Chapter 1-150
<br><br>
A collection of 150 songs that Israel sang to God (and to each other)—kind of like a hymnal for the ancient Israelites.

Author: So many authors including David.

The Book of Psalms is the hymn book and prayer book of the Bible. While some were famousy composed by David, the whole collection was the work of different authors over a long period of time. These hymns and prayers were collected and used by the people of Israel in their worship. and eventually this collection was incuded in their Scriptures.
 These religious poems are of many kinds: there are hymns of praise and worship of God; prayers for help. protection, and salvation; pleas for forgiveness; songs of thanksgiving for God's blessings; and petitions for the punishment of enemies. These prayers are both personal and national; some portray the most intimate feelings of one person, while others represent the needs and feelings of all the people of God.
 Psalm 23, the 'Shepherd Psalm, is one of the best-known and best loved passages of Scripture. The psalms were used by Jesus, quoted by the writers of the New Testament, and became the treasured book of worship of the Christian Church from its very beginning.

20. Proverbs: Chapter 1-31
<br><br>
A collection of sayings written to help people make wise decisions that bring about justice.

Author: Solomon and other wise men.

The Book of Proverbs is a collection of moral and religious teachings, mostly in the form of short sayings and proverbs. Much of it has to do with practical, everyday concerns. It begins with the reminder that "The fear of the LoRD is the beginning of knowledge" (1:7), and then goes on to deal with matters not only of religious morality, but also of common sense and good manners.
 Its many short sayings reveal the insights of ancient Israelite teachers about what a wise person
 will do in certain situations. Some of these concern family relations, others business dealings. Some deal with matters of etiquette in social relationships, and others with the need for self-control. Much is said about such qualities as humility, patience, respet for the poor, and loyalty to friends. While what was thought to be good behaviour in ancient Israelite society underlies Proverbs, much of its advice is still as relevant today as it ever was.

21. Ecclesiates: Chapter 1-12
<br><br>
A philosophical exploration of the meaning of life—with a surprisingly nihilistic tone for the Bible.
Author: Traditionally Solomon.

Ecclesiastes contains the thoughts of "the Teacher", a man who reflected deeply on how short and contradictory human ife is, with its mysterious injustices and frustrations, finally concluding that life was "meaningless". He could not understand the ways of God, who controls human destiny, Yet, in spite of this, he advised people to work hard, and to enjoy the gifts of God as much and
 as long as they could. odot fud 229niggsd stsg
 Many of the Teacher's thoughts appear negative and even depressing. But the fact that this book is in the Bible shows that biblical faith is broad enough to take into account such pessimism and doubt. Many have taken comfort in seeing themselves in the mirror of Eccesiastes, and have discovered that the same Bible which refiects these thoughts, when read as a whole, also offers the
 hope in God that finally does give life its greater meaning.der assla oniearlaobseutsy nd Successor Sioeyelsoiarloilsboot sedvM

28. Hosea: Chapter 1-14
<br><br>
Hosea is told to marry a prostitute who leaves him, and he must bring her back: a picture of God’s relationship with Israel.

Author: Hosea.

The prophet Hosea preached in the northern kingdom of israel, after the prophet Amos anc during the troubled times before the fall of Sarmaria in 721 BC. He was especially concerned abou: the idolatry of the people and their faithlessness towards God. The Book of Hosea boldy pictures this faithlessness in terrms of Hosea's own disastrous marriage to an unfaithful woman. Just as Hosea's wife Gomer turned out to be unfaithful to him, so God's people had deserted the LORD. For this judgment would fall on Israel. But Hosea loved his wife and took her back again and in the same way God's constant love for his people would finaly prevail and he would win the nation back tc himself and restore their relationship. This love is expressed in the moving words: "How can Igive you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can Itreat you ike Admah? How can Imake you like Zeboim? My heart is changed within me; all ny compassion is aroused" (11:8).

The Book of Amos records the words of the first prophet in the Bible whose message was recorde at length. Aithough he came from a town in Judah, he preached to the people of the norther kingdom of Israel, about the middle of the eighth century BC. It was a time of great prosperit, notable religious piety, and apparent security. But Amos saw that prosperity was limited to the wealthy, and that it fed on injustice and on oppression of the poor. Religious observance was insincere and security more apparent than real. With passion and cOurage he preached that God wou'c punish the nation. He called for justice to flow "likea river" (5:24), but he also said, "Perhaps the LORD God Almighty will have mercy" on the people of Israel who were still left alive (5:15).

32. Jonah: Chapter 1-4
<br><br>
A disobedient prophet runs from God, is swallowed by a great fish, and then preaches God’s message to the city of Nineveh.

Author: Traditionally Jonah.

The Book of Jonah is unlike other prophetic books of the Bible in thatit is a narrative, descibing the adventures of a prophet who tried to disobey God's command. God told him to go to Nineveh, the capital of the great empire of Assyria, Israel's deadly enemy. But Jonah did not want to go there with God's message, because he was convinced that God would not carry out his threat to destroy the city. After a series of dramatic events, including his well-known episode "inside the fish", he reluctantly obeyed God's call but finally sulked when his message of doom did not come
 true.
 Jonah portrays God's absolute sovereignty over his creation. But above all it portrays God as a God of love and mercy, who would choose to forgive even the worst enemies of his people and save them, rather than punish and destroy them.

Habbakuk was deeply disturbed by the violence of these cruel people, and asked the LORD, "Why are you silent while the wicked swalow up those more righteous than themselves?" (1:13). The LoRD'S answer was that he would take action in his own good time, and that meanwhile, those who are righteous would live by faith in him (2:4).

<h2 style="text-align: center;">New Testament</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">THE GOSPELS</h3>The New Testament includes 27 books about Jesus’ ministry and what it means to follow him. The first four books of the New Testament are called the Gospels.
<p>
40. Mathew: Chapter 1-28
<br><br>
This is an account of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection, focusing on Jesus’ role as the true king of the Jews.

Author: Matthew.


The Gospel of Matthew tells the good news that Jesus is the promised Saviour,
 the one through
 whom God fuifilled the promises he made to his people in the Old Testament. This good news is not only for the Jewish people, among whom Jesus was born and lived, but for the whole world. Matthew is carefully arranged. It begins with the birth of Jesus, goes on to describe his baptism and temptation, and then takes up his ministry of preaching, teaching, and healing in Galleel. After this the Gospel records Jesus' journey from Galilee to Jerusalem and the events of Jesus'
 last week, culminating in his crucifixion and resurrection.
 This Gospel presenits Jesus as the great Teacher, who has the authority to intepret the Law of God, and who teaches about God's kingdom, what Matthew so frequenty records as the "kingdom of heaven". Much of Jesus' teaching is gathered by subject matter into five collections: (1) The Sermon on the Mount, which concerns the character, duties, privileges, and destiny of the citizens of the kingdom of heaven (chapters 5-7); 2) Instructions to the tweve disciples for their mission (chapter 10); G) Parables about the kingdom of heaven (chapter 13): (4) Teaching on the meaning of discipleship (chapter 18), and (5) Teaching about the end of the present age and the coming of the kingdom of heaven (chapters 24-25).

<br><br>
41. Mark: Chapter 1-16
<br><br>
This brief account of Jesus’ earthly ministry highlights Jesus’ authority and servanthood.

Author: John Mark.

The Gospel of Mark begins with the statement that it is "the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God". Jesus is pictured as a man of action and authority. His authority is seen in his teaching, in his power over demons, and in forgiving people's sins. Jesus speaks of hinself as the Son of Man, who came to give his life to set people free from sin.
 Mark presernts the story of Jesus in a straightforward, vigorous way, with emphasis on what Jesus did, rather than on his words and teachings. Conscious that so many readers would not have a Jewish background, Mark contains careful explanations of Jewish culture and local geography,. After a brief prologue about John the Baptist and the baptism and temptation of Jesus, the writer immediately takes up Jesus" ministry of healing and teaching. As time goes on, the followers of Jesus come to understand him better, but Jesus' opponents become more hostile. The closing chapters
 report the events of Jesus' last week of earthly life, especially hs crucifixion and resurrection. The two endings to the Gospel, which are enclosed in brackets, are generally regarded as written
 later by someone other than the author of Mark.

42. Luke: Chapter 1-24
<br><br>
Luke writes the most thorough account of Jesus’ life, pulling together eyewitness testimonies to tell the full story of Jesus.

Author: Luke.

The Gospel of Luke presents Jesus as both the promised Saviour of Israel and as the Saviour of the whole human race. Luke records that Jesus was called by the Spirit of the Lord to "preach good news to the poor" (4:18), and this Gospel is filed with a concern for people with all kinds of need. The note of joy is also prominent in Luke, especially in the opening chapters that announce the coming of Jesus, and again at the conclusion, when Jesus ascends to heaven. The story of the growth and spread of the Christian faith after the ascension of Jesus is told by the same writer in Acts which, like Luke, is dedicated to the unknown Theophilus, the writer's friend or perhaps his sponsor.
 There are two sections (chapters 1-2 and 9-19) which contain much material that is found only in this Gospel, such as the stories about the song of the angels and the shepherds' visit at the birth of Jesus, Jesus in the Temple as a boy, and the parables of the Good Sarmaritan and the Lost Son. Throughout the Gospel great emphasis is placed on prayer, the Holy Spirit, the role of women in the ministry of Jesus, and God's forgiverness of sins.

<p>
45. Romans: Chapter 1-16
<br><br>
Paul summarizes how the gospel of Jesus works in a letter to the churches at Rome, where he plans to visit.

Author: Paul.

Paul wrote his important Letter to the Romans to prepare the way for a visit he planned to make to the church at Rome. His plan was to work among the Christians there for a while and then, with their support, to go on to Spain. He wrote this detailed and closely-argued letter to explain his understanding of the Christian faith and its practical implications for the lives of Christians. Romans contains Paul's most complete statenent of his message.
 After greeting the people of the church at Rome and teling them of his prayers for then, Paul states the theme of the letter: "For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last" (1:17).
 Paul then develops this theme. The whole human race, both Jew and Gentile, needs to be put right with God, for all alike are under the power of sin. People are put right with God through faith in Jesus Christ. Next Paul describes the new life in union with Christ that results from this new relationship with God. The believer has peace with God and is set free by God's Spirit from the power of sin and death. In chapters 5-8 Paul also discusses the purpose of the Law of God and the pOwer of God's Spirit in the believer's life. Then the apostle wrestles with the question of how Jews and Gentiles fit into the plan of God for humanity. He concludes that the Jewish rejection of Jesus is part of God's plan for bringing the whole human race within the reach of God's grace in Jesus Christ, and he believes that the Jevws will not always reject Jesus. Finally Paul writes about how the Christian life should be lived, especially about the way of love in relations with others. He takes up such themes as service to God, the duty of Christians to the state and to one another, and questions of conscience. He ends the letter with personal messages and with words of praise to God.

46. 1 Corinthians: Chapter 1-16
<br><br>
Paul writes a disciplinary letter to a fractured church in Corinth, and answers some questions that they’ve had about how Christians should behave.

Author: Paul.

Paul wrote his First Letter to the Corinthians to deal with problems of Christian life and faith that had arisen in the church which Paul had established at Corinth. At that time, Corinth was a great, cosmopolitan Greek city, the capital of the Roman province of Achaia. It was noted for its thriving commerce, proud cuture, widespread immorality, and variety of religions.
 The apostle's chief concerns are with problens such as divisiveness and immorality in the church, and with questions about sex and marriage, matters of conscience, church order, gifts of the Holy Spirit, and the resurrection. With deep insight he shows how the Good News speaks to each of these questions.
 Chapter 13, which presents love as the best of God's gifts to his people, is probably the most widely known passage in the book.

<br><br>
Paul writes a letter of reconciliation to the church at Corinth, and clears up some concerns that they have.

Author: Paul.

Paul wrote his Second Letter to the Corinthians during a difficult period in his relationship with the church at Corinth. Some members of the church had evidently made strong criticisns of Paul and his role, but he shows his deep longing for reconciliation and expresses his great joy when this is brought about.
 In the first part of the letter Paul discusses his relationship with the church at Corinth, explaining why he had responded with severity when he was opposed and insulted by some members of the church there and expressing his joy that this severity had resulted in repentance and reconciliation. Then he appeals to the church for a generous offering to help the needy Christians in Judea. In the final chapters Paul defends his apostleship against a few people at Corinth who had set thenseves up as true apostles, while accusing Paul of being a false one.

51. Colossians: Chapter 1-4
<br><br>
Paul writes the church at Colossae a letter about who they are in Christ, and how to walk in Christ.

Author: Paul.

Paul wrote his Letter to the Colossians to the church at Colosse, town in Asia Minor east of Ephesus. This church had not been established by Paul, but was in an area for which Paul felt, responsible, as he sent out workers from Ephesus, the capital of the Roman province of Asia. Paul had learned that there were false teachers in the church at Colosse who insisted that in order to know God and have full salvation Christians must also worship certain 'spiritual rulers and authorities'. In addition, these teachers said, people must submit to special rites such as circumcision and must observe strict rules about foods and other matters.
 Paul writes to oppose these teachings with the true Christian message. The heart of his reply is that Jesus Christ is able to give ful salvation and that these other beliefs and practices actually lead people away from him. Through Christ, God created the word and through him he is bringing it back to himself. Only in union with Christ is there hope of salvation for the world. Paul then spells out the implications of this great teaching for the lives of believers.
 It is noteworthy that Tychicus, who took this letter to Colosse for Paul, was accompanied by .Onesimus, the slave on whose behalf Paul wrote his letter to Philemon.

<br><br>
Paul has heard a good report on the church at Thessalonica, and encourages them to “excel still more” in faith, hope, and love.

Author: Paul.

Confusion over the expected return of Christ continued to cause disturbances in the church at Thessalonica. Paul's Second Letter to the Thessalonians deals with the belief that the day of the Lord's coming had already arrived. Paul corrects this idea, pointing out that before Christ returns, evil and wickedness wil reach a cimax under the leadership of a mysterious figure called "the man of lawlessness" (2:3), who would be opposed to Christ.
 The apostle emphasizes the need for his readers to remain steady in their faith in spite of trouble and suffering, to work for a living as did Paul and his fellow-workers, and to persevere in doing good.

 First, Titus is rerninded of the kind of character that church leaders should have, especially in view of the bad character of many Cretans. Next, Titus is advised how to teach the various groups in the church, the older men, the older women (who are, in turn, to teach the younger women), the young men, and the slaves.

66. Revelation: Chapter 1-22
<br><br>
John sees visions of things that have been, things that are, and things that are yet to come.

Author: John.

The Revelation to John was written at a time when Christians were being persecuted because of their faith in Jesus Christ as Lord. The writer's main concern is to give his readers hope and encouragement, and to urge them to remain faithful during times of suffering and persecution.
 For the most part the book consists of several series of revelations and visions presented in symboic language that would have been understood by Christians of that day, but would have remained a mystery to all others. As with the themes of a symphony, the themes of this book are repeated again and again in different ways through the various series of visions. Although there are differernces of opinion regarding the details of interpretation of the book, the central theme is clear: through Christ the Lord, God will finally and totally defeat all his enemies, incuding Satan, and will reward his faithful people with the blessings of a new heaven and a new earth when this victory is complete
