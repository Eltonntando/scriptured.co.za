<h2>All the 66 Books in the Bible</h2>
<h3>The length of the Bible—about 611,000 words spread across 66 shorter texts known as its "books"—is enormous.

This is so because the Bible is a compilation of texts from several authors who lived in various eras. We can read the Bible in "chunks" rather than having to read it all at once, which in some ways makes it simpler to approach.
However, it also adds some confusion. The Bible is a book unto itself. The Latin and Greek words for "book" (biblia and biblos, respectively) are actually where the word "bible" originates. It's a collection of books, though. Here is a summary of each Bible book.
</h3>
<br><br>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Old Testament</h2>
<br><br>
The Old Testament includes 39 books which were written long before Jesus was born.
The first five books of the Bible are called the Torah, or the Law of Moses.
<h3 style="text-align: center;">THE LAW</h3>
<p>
Genesis: Chapter 1-50
<br><br>
1. Genesis answers two of massive questions: “How did God’s relationship with the world begin?” and “Where did the nation of Israel come from?” This is where the stories of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah and the Ark, the Tower of Babel, Abraham and Isaac, Jacob’s ladder, and Joseph’s coat of many colors are recorded.

Author: Traditionally Moses, but the stories are much older.
Genesis means origin orthe begginings. Ranging from the cosmos to the family, this wide-sweping book tells of the universe, the origin of the human race, the beginning of sin and sufferig in the world, and about God's way of dealing with humanity.

Genesis can be divided into two main parts: 1st. The creation of the world and the early history of the human race. Here are accounts af Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah and the flood, and together with the Tower of Babel (Chapters 1-11). 2nd. The History of the early ancestors of the Israelites.The first is Abraham, who was notable for his faith and his obedience to God. Thenfollow the stories of his son Isaac, and grandson Jacob (also known as Israel), and of Jacob's twelve sons, who were the founders of the twelve tribes of Israel. Particular attension is given to one of the sons, Joseph, and the events that brought Jacob and his other sons with their families to live in Egypt(Chapters 12-50).

While the Book of Genesis tells stories about people, it is first and foremost an account of what God has done. Introducing the drama of redemption, it begins with the affirmation that God created the universe, and it ends with a promise that God will continue to show his concern for his people. Throughout the book the main character is God, who creates human beings to live in his world, leads and helps his people, judges and punishes those who do wrong, and shapes their history. This ancient book was written to record the story of a people's faith and to help keep that faith alive.

Author: Traditionally Moses

Exodus means depature, and refers to the most important event in Israel's history, which is described in this book - The freeing of te Israelites from bondage and their depature from Egypt, where they had been enslaved by the Pharoah.
The Book of Exodus has four main parts: 1st The miraculous freeing of the Hebrews from slavery; 2nd Their dramatic journey to Mount Sinai; 3rd God's covenant with his people at Snai, which gave them moral, civil, and religious laws to live by; 4th The building and furnishing of a place of worship for Israel, and laws regarding the priests and the worship of God. Above all, Exodus describes what God did, liberating his enslaved people and forming them into a nation with hope for the future. The lord is shown to be the one true God, ruler of the universe, whose will is unstopaable. The central human figure in the book is Moses, the man whom God chose to lead his people from Egypt. The most widely known part of the book is the list of the 'Ten Commandments' (20:1-17).

Leviticus is named after the tribe of Levi, from which came all the priests and all those who looked after the religious ceremonies associated with the Tent of Meeting and later the Temple. The Book of Leviticus contains the regulations for worship and religious ceremonies in encient Israel, and for the priests who were carrying out these instructions.
The main theme of the book is the holiness of God and the ways in which his people were to worship and live so as to maintain their relationship with him. The best known words from the book are those which Jesus called the second great commandment: "love your neighbour as yourself" (19:18)

4. Numbers: Chapter 1-36
<br><br>
Israel is failing to trust and obey God, and wanders in the wilderness for a period of 40 years.

Author: Traditionally Moses
The book of Numbers is the account of Israelites' life in the desert from the time they left Mount Sinai until they reached the eastern border of Canaan, the land that God had promised to give them, a journey which took them nearly forty years. Numbers, the name of the book, emphisises an important feature of the story, the two censuses of the Israelites which Moses orginised, first at Mount Sinai before their depature, and again in Moab, east of the Jordan, about a generation later. In the period between Moses' two censuses, the Israelites went to Kadesh Brnea of the southern border of Canaan, but they failed to rnter the promised land from there. They spent many years in that area before proceeding to the region east of the River Jordan, where some of the people settled while the others prepared to cross the river into Canaan, their promised land. Numbers tells of people who were often discouraged and afraid in the face of hardship, people who rebelled against God and against Moses, the man God appointed to lead them. Yet it is also the story of God's faithfulness, his persistent care for his people in spite of their weakness and disobedience. It is also the record of Moses, steadfast, if sometimes impatient, devotion of both to God and his people.

5. Deuteronomy: Chapter 1-34
<br><br>
Moses is giving Israel instructions and guide (in a way, it is a recap of the laws in Exodus–Numbers) for how to love and obey God in the Promised Land.

Author: Traditionally Moses

The framework of the book of Deuteronomy ('second law') is a series of addresses given by Moses to the people of Israel in Moab, where they had stopped at the end of their long desert journey and were about to enter Canaan, the land God has promised them. Some of the most important matters recorded in Deuteronomy are: 1st Moses' retelling of the great events of the past forty years in the desert, appearing to the people to remember how God led them through the their long journey and to be loyal and obedient to God. 2nd MMoses review the law given to him on Mount Sinai, the 'The Ten Commandments', emphrasing the meaning of the first laws which are to govern Israel's life in their promised land. 3rd Moses' powerful reminder to the people of the serious meaning of God's covanant with them. Moses calls upon them to renew their commitment to it and to their obligation to God. 4th Joshua's commissioning as the next leader upon the tribes of Israel, Moses in Moab, east of the Jordan River.

The great theme of Deuteronomy is that God has saved and blessed his chosen people whom he loves. His people must remember this and obey and love God so that they may have life and continued blessing. The key verses of this book contain the words that Jesus called the greatest of all commandments: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength" (6:5)

6. Joshua: Chapter 1-24
<br><br>
Joshua becomes Israel’s new leader and leads Israel to conquer the Promised land, then parcels out territories to the twelve tribes of Israel. The Battle of Jericho and the day the sun stood still, but most of the action happens in the first half of this book. The last half is mostly about divvying in to real estate.

Author: Nobody knows

The book of Joshua is the story of the Israelite invasion of Canaan, the land God has promised them, under the leadership of Joshua, the successor of Moses, it also sets out the division of Canaan among the tribes. Notable events recorded in this book include the crossing of the Jordan, the fall of Jericho, the battle at Ai, and the renewal of the covenant between God and his people. One of the best knownpassages in the book is, "choose for your selves this day whom you will serve...as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD" (24:15)

7. Judges: Chapter 1-21
<br><br>
Israel enters a cycle of turning from God, falling captive to oppressive nations, calling out to God, and being rescued by leaders God sends their way (called “judges”).

Author: Nobody knows

The book of Judges contains accounts of events which took place during the lawless period of Israel's history between the invasion of Canaan and the establishment of the monarchy. These stories are about the exploits of national heroes called 'judges', most of whom were military leaders rather than judges in the strictly legal sense of the word. One of the better known of them was Samson, whose deeds are recorded in chapters 13-16.
The great and obvious lesson of Judges is that Israel's very survival depended on loyalty to God, while disloyalty always led to disaster. But at another level there is a deeper, underlying truth: even when the nation was disloyal to God, and even when disaster inevitably came, God was always ready to save his people when they repented and turned to him again.
